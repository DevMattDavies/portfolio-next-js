export const aboutText = `I love designing things for the web. Originally coming
  from a project management background, I immediately fell in love
  with the balance between logic and art that web design demands.
  A product of an intensive bootcamp - now a full-stack developer who
  is comfortable using modern technologies and languages such as React, Next JS and TypeScript
  to achieve beautiful and flexible designs that can scale to user needs.`;

export const techText = `Leveraging a range of languages and technologies to produce
  complete, end-to-end applications is at the heart of what I do. A solid understanding of the fundamentals - HTML, CSS and JavaScript - before moving on to back-end and learning to create apps utilising
  the power of Express, Node JS, and database storage. More recently
  I've been able to consolidate this knowledge and, with the help of
  React and Next JS, create more complex user interfaces and
  dynamically interactive webpages that can efficiently scale to
  user demands. During my time at School of Code, there has also been a focus on
  non-programming skills; wireframing with Figma, project tracking
  using Trello and Jira, and project methodology with an Agile
  approach.`;
